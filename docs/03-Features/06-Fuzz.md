Note that the tool sends GET requests to the specified base URL with a list of paths. By default, it uses both file format fuzzing and path fuzzing. You can enable or disable either type of fuzzing by specifying the corresponding option. However, it's essential to use this tool responsibly and with the proper permissions. Sending too many requests to a website without permission may be considered an attack and may be illegal.
